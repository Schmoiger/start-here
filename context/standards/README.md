## DRY Principle

Each topic lives in **one** authoritative place. Other standards cross-reference rather than duplicate. If you find the same guidance in two places, the standard listed in the "Purpose" column above is the authority.

## Frontmatter Convention

All standards use YAML frontmatter with: `purpose`, `audience`, `read-when`, `not-for`, `related`.
